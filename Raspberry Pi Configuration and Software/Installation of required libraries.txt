
Python 3.11 is now installed on your Raspberry Pi.

## Installation of Necessary Libraries

### Installing Essential Libraries

The project relies on specific libraries for data analysis and hardware interaction. Here's how to install them:

1. Install the required libraries:

- PySerial for communication with the ACS712 current sensor:

  ```
  pip install pyserial
  ```

- Numpy for data analysis and FFT calculations:

  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```

- Matplotlib for data visualization:

  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

- RPi.GPIO for controlling GPIO pins:

  ```
  pip install RPi.GPIO
  ```

- Flask for creating a web interface:

  ```
  pip install Flask
  ```

With the necessary libraries in place, you're ready to begin programming the Asynchronous Motor Fault Diagnosis System.

## Next Steps

With your Raspberry Pi prepared and Python 3.11 and libraries installed, you can now proceed to [programming the system](#programming) and using it for asynchronous motor fault diagnosis.
