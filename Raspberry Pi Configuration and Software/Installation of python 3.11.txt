
Your Raspberry Pi is now set up and ready for the next steps in the project.
In this project, we encountered a critical compatibility issue between the required Python version, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
 The latest versions of NumPy and Matplotlib necessitated Python 3.11, which, at the time, wasn't readily available through the standard repositories.
 To address this compatibility challenge, we utilized the "deadsnakes" function, which allowed us to force the installation of a Python version that was compatible with both NumPy and Matplotlib

## Installation of Python 3.11

### Step-by-Step Python 3.11 Installation

Python 3.11 is a critical part of this project. Here's how to install it on your Raspberry Pi:

1. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.

2. Run the following commands to install Python 3.11:

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install python3.11

3. Verify the installation by checking the Python version:

	python3.11--version
