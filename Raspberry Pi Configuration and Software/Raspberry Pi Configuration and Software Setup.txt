# Raspberry Pi Configuration and Software Setup

This section will guide you through the process of configuring your Raspberry Pi and setting up the necessary software for the Asynchronous Motor Fault Diagnosis System.

## Raspberry Pi Setup

### Hardware and Software Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following hardware and software:

- Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 3B+ or later)
- MicroSD card (16GB or larger recommended)
- Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
- HDMI cable and monitor (for initial setup)
- USB keyboard and mouse (for initial setup)
- Internet connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
- Raspberry Pi Imager software (downloadable from the official Raspberry Pi website)

### Step 1: Download and Install Raspberry Pi Imager

1. Download and install the Raspberry Pi Imager from the official Raspberry Pi website. This tool simplifies the process of setting up your Raspberry Pi.

### Step 2: Choose an Operating System

1. Launch the Raspberry Pi Imager software.

2. Click on "Choose OS."

3. Select "Raspberry Pi OS (other)" and choose the latest version.

4. Click "Choose SD Card" and select your microSD card.

### Step 3: Write the Operating System

1. Click "Write" in the Raspberry Pi Imager to start writing the Raspberry Pi OS to the microSD card.

2. Wait for the writing process to complete. This may take a few minutes.

3. Once done, safely eject the microSD card from your computer.

### Step 4: Insert the microSD Card

1. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi.

2. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a monitor using an HDMI cable, and attach a keyboard and mouse.

3. Connect the power supply to your Raspberry Pi to boot it up.

### Step 5: Initial Setup

1. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial setup, including setting your country, language, time zone, and password.

2. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet using Wi-Fi or Ethernet during the setup.

### Step 6: Update and Upgrade

1. Once the initial setup is complete, open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.

2. Run the following commands to ensure your Raspberry Pi is up to date:
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt upgrade


3. This will update the operating system and software packages.

### Step 7: Enable SSH (Optional)

1. If you plan to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, enable SSH:

- Go to the Raspberry Pi Configuration in the Preferences menu.
- Navigate to the "Interfaces" tab and enable SSH.

### Step 8: Reboot

1. Reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:
		sudo reboot
